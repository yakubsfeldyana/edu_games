I have a simple static website in directory "ai_dog_park/website".
It uses html pages, one styles.css, javascript, images under images directory.
create a small python script to convert json file into "js' file
=======================================================
Right now the website used external python script to determine which file in json folder it will use. Keep the functionality of the game but redo it to not use python at all, and only use terms_ai.json file.
