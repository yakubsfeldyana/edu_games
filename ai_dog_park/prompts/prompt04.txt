=======================================================
There are only ten dog available to be placed in the dog park. 
The number of dogs available to be placed in the park has to remain 10, until the sum of the numbers of both the dogs already placed in the park and the dogs avialable to be placed in the park equates the number of definitions in the json file. It should never be more than the number of definitions in the json file.
