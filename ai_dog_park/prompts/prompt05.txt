I have a simple static website hosting an interactive game in the directory "ai_dog_park/website".
It uses an html page, one styles.css, javascript, and  images under images directory.
Please update the header with the words "AI Terms.." to take up less space.  
The "Next Question" button should appear faster then it does now.
=====================================================
Make the header section smaller and replace the text with "Dog Park Quiz"
Move the counters to the header.
Make the answer buttons smaller.
When the wrong answer is selected, I want a dog outside of the dog park to bounce.
Make the dog park area smaller as well.
Make the answer buttons even smaller.
==================================
remove "available dogs" counter
Remove the bounce animation from a dog when the wrong answer is selected.
When the page is viewed on mobile, make the stacked buttons narrower than they are now.
=======================================================
I want the header, the middle section and the dog park area be shorter by 50 px.
