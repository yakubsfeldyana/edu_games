I have a simple static website in directory "ai_dog_park/website".
It uses html pages, one styles.css, javascript, images under images directory.
The website serves an interactive game similar to this: https://javaranch.com/game/game2.jsp 
using the following json as a source of questions and answers
 "ai_terms.json" located in the website directory.

 I want  the game to be built useing only Javascript, functionality to  be as follows:
 the game should display a number of dogs walking back and forth in the top of the screen with the dog park below them.
 The dogs should be funny, wagging tails and bouncing, drawn in primitive style.
 For each correct answer, a dog shold be placed from the top section into the dog park.
 when placed in the dog park, the dog should continue wolking back and forth.
 ======================================================
 when the game is run from index.html, this error appears 
 Error
Failed to load questions. Please check that ai_terms.json exists and is properly formatted.

Make sure you have an 'ai_terms.json' file with the following format:
{
  "terms": [
    {
      "term": "Machine Learning",
      "definition": "A subset of AI..."
    }
  ]
}
ensure that the file can be loaded from box localhost command and index.html as well
=======================================================
the dogs in the game look like birds. The dogs in the game should look like dogs, with longer legs, dog tails and ears.
when turning around, they should not move backwards, but the image should flip instead, so that they are always moving with their head forward.
=========================
The dogs look like their bodies are separated from their heads and limbs. Please fix.
=======================================================
use dog1_walking.svg and dog5_walking.svg  and animated_dog_with_head_tail.svg in the images folder for the dog animation
