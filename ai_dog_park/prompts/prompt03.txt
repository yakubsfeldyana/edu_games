I have a simple static website hosting an interactive game in the directory "ai_dog_park/website".
It uses an html page, one styles.css, javascript, and  images under images directory.

 Make this AI quiz game more compact and space-efficient. Please reduce the overall size by making the following adjustments:

- Shrink the decorative elements - make the dog illustrations smaller and reduce the spacing around them
- Compress the Dog Park header section - reduce its height and padding
- Make the question text more compact - reduce font size and line spacing while keeping it readable
- Shrink the answer buttons - make them smaller with less padding and spacing between them
- Reduce overall margins and padding throughout the interface

Keep the visual design and functionality the same, just make everything more compact so it takes up less vertical space on the screen.
